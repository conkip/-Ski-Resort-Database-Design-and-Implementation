||  Class Queries
||

||
||        Purpose:  This class provides methods for executing SQL queries
||                  against the ski resort Oracle database. It handles
||                  user-driven query selection and processes results
||                  for display through a command-line interface.
||
||  Inherits From:  None.
||
||     Interfaces:  None.

  |  Constructor Queries
  |
  |  Purpose:  Initializes the Queries object with a JDBC database
  |      connection and a Scanner object for user input. It attempts
  |      to create a SQL statement object for executing queries.
  |
  |  Pre-condition:
  |      - dbconn must be a valid, active JDBC Connection to the Oracle DB.
  |      - scanner must be an initialized Scanner object.
  |
  |  Post-condition:
  |      - The Queries object is ready to execute SQL SELECT queries.
  |      - A Statement object is created; any SQLException will be printed.
  |
  |  Parameters:
  |      dbconn -- (IN) a valid JDBC Connection to the Oracle database.
  |      scanner -- (IN) a Scanner object for reading user input.
  |
  |  Returns:  None.

  |  Method performQueries
  |
  |  Purpose:  Prompts the user to choose from a list of predefined
  |      SQL queries and calls the appropriate method to execute the
  |      query and display the results.
  |
  |  Pre-condition:  Scanner must be initialized and connected to input;
  |      the Oracle connection must be valid and active.
  |
  |  Post-condition:  The selected query is executed and its output is
  |      printed to the console. Invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
  |
  |  Parameters:  None.
  |
  |  Returns:  None.
